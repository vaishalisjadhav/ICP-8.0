    <p>It is one of the largest lakes in Solapur that was recently sheltered by the government for <br> a beautification and conservation mission. Take a long walk along the lake in the evening and <br> spend some leisure hours watching people.It can be a good pit-stop for you <br> and your family to steal a few moments of self-indulgence before turning in for the night.</p>

    <h3>2. Science Centre</h3>

    <p>The Solapur Science Center is one of the most visited attractions in the city <br> and arguably the most iconic science museum in the state. The establishment of this <br> center was aimed to propagate and promote science among the masses. <br> Through its various exhibitions that can be participated in throughout the year, <br> it propagates scientific principles and ideas through simple visual showcases for kids and adults.</p>
